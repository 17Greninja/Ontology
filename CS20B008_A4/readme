For, running the program: python3 a4.py

This is will generate the required files:

The main program a4.py extracts the rdf triples and stores them in the extracted.rdf file.
The room.rdf file contains only the triples, it is a subset of the extracted.rdf file.
The inferred triples are stored in the inferred.rdf file.
hotel.xml contains the xml data
a3.owl has the ontolgy from assignment 3.
The consistency of the rdf triples has been checked using the HermiT reasoner, and the triples are consistent.
